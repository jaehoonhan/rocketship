## Overview
### Description
Using [Polygon API](https://polygon.io/), Rocketship retrieves live data from the New York Stock Exchange and allows users to experiment with stock purchases in a sandbox. This means that the user doesn't have to spend real money to see what the outcome of a play would have been, all while being based on real stock prices and movements.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Financial technology, Experimentation, Education, Sandbox.
- **Web/Mobile:** This app takes a web first approach, but is fully viable for usage as a mobile app. 
- **Story:** The stock market can be daunting to new investors, but with Rocketship, it no longer has to be. By experimenting in Rocketship's sandbox, users can test out their trading ideas without the risk of losing money, and find out if the decisions they've made would have returned gains for them in the real world.
- **Market:** This app is geared toward new investors looking to test their trading knowledge, intermediate investors looking to experiment with risky plays without losing real money, or advanced investors who want a tool to assist them in calculating many different outcomes.
- **Habit:** Being a sandbox, the user retention can vary greatly upon individual users. The curious will come back to Rocketship often to find answers to their "what if" questions, while the uninquiring may use Rocketship much less to make certain calculations or predictions based on what they conclude after playing in the sandbox.
- **Scope:** Our primary audience would be beginner traders and financial students, however users of all levels of experience will find something useful about Rocketship's powerful sandbox capability.
